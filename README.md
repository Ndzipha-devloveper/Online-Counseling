🌍 Online Counseling School Group Project

💬 Project Purpose

We building this platform to make mental health support more accessible, inclusive, and stigma-free for all people. Whether someone is facing stress, grief, anxiety, or simply needs someone to talk to, our online counseling homepage offers a safe digital space where help is just a click away.

We design this homepage as the foundation for a broader digital counseling ecosystem—one that grows to include multilingual support, live chat, therapist directories, and mental health resources tailored to diverse communities.

🧠 Problems We Solve
Traditional counseling often comes with barriers. Our platform helps solve these by offering:

Convenient Access – People reach out from anywhere, using any device, without needing to travel or wait for in-person appointments.

Privacy & Discretion – Users engage with the platform in private, reducing fear of judgment or exposure.

Flexible Scheduling – The site supports asynchronous contact and can expand to include real-time chat or booking features.

Affordability – By reducing overhead and travel costs, online counseling becomes more affordable and scalable.

Expanded Reach – People in rural or underserved areas connect with support they might not otherwise access.

Comfortable Environment – Users interact from familiar settings, which reduces anxiety and encourages openness.

Every section of the site—from the mission statement to the contact form—is built with empathy, clarity, and professional polish. We want users to feel seen, supported, and safe.

*👥 Team Contributions*
*Our group consists of 10 dedicated members, each playing a vital role in building this platform with empathy, professionalism, and technical precision.*
Frontend Lead: Siyamthanda Ndzipha (Edison) Builds layout, ensures responsiveness, handles deployment troubleshooting and chooses calming color palettes, crafts wireframes, and makes sure the site is visually accessible and emotionally supportive.

A few teammates focus on backend development, using Python frameworks like Flask or Django. They set up routing, handle form submissions, and connect the frontend to a secure SQLite database.

Our content and copywriting team writes the mission statement, service descriptions, and team bios. They make sure every word reflects warmth, clarity, and professionalism.

The form and validation team implements JavaScript logic for client-side validation and connects it to backend processing for secure data handling.

A few members take charge of testing and quality assurance, manually checking the site across browsers, validating HTML/CSS, and running accessibility audits using tools like Lighthouse.

Our deployment and DevOps team configures GitHub Pages, sets up HTTPS, and prepares the backend for cloud deployment on platforms like Render or Railway.

One teammate handles documentation, writing the README, setup guides, and future roadmap to ensure the project is easy to maintain and scale.

Another teammate leads research and strategy, identifying user needs, mental health challenges, and the broader impact this platform can have in underserved communities.

Finally, our project coordinator keeps everything moving—organizing meetings, tracking progress, and making sure collaboration stays smooth and focused.
